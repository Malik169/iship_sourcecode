# 📱 iShip – iPhone Shipping Website

I was so bored, I asked my mom what I should make.  
She said: *“a website that buys iPhones.”*  
So I actually made it. Well... sort of.

This is **iShip**, a website where you can submit a form to ship your iPhone anywhere in the world. It works and even sends me an email when someone fills the form!

We’re not MrBeast, so we don’t *actually* have the iPhones (yet 😅).  
But if you’ve got the money 💰 – maybe you can help make it real.
